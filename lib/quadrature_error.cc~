/* QUADRATURE IMBALANCE ERROR FOR QAM
 * We estimate the quadrature imbalance error qe finding the horizontal and vertical angle of the constellation displacement. 
 * We assume that the displacement of the cosntellation points has the following axes symmetry.
 * If the constellation has for example these two points: x+jy and -x+jy, a vertical quadrature error moves the points to x+j(y+u) and -x+j(y-u) 
 * In order to estimate the qe error we use the following outer constellation points: right up point,right down point, left up point 
 * We give the angles in radians.
 * The estimation of the qe error uses the di vector (see ste.cc). 
 * This vector has the distance between the theoretical symbol point and the corresponding mean point of the cloud of this symbol point. 
 * If there are other linear distorsions (carrier suppression and amplitude imbalance) do not influence the calculation of qe errors.  
 * update_qe returns void but the angles are passed by reference to the function.
 * quadrature error object is called  to update qe with each sample received. This class uses the demapper class to find the four outer constellation points
